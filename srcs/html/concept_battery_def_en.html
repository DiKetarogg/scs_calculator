A battery is an energy source consisting of one or more electrochemical cells and terminals on both ends called an anode (-) and a cathode (+). Electrochemical cells transform chemical energy into electrical energy. Inside the battery is an electrolyte, often consisting of soluble salts or acids, it serves as a conductive medium, allowing the electric charge to travel through the battery.
Depending on its voltage and load, a single battery can power anything from a car's motor or a computer to a cellphone or a light bulb. When it comes to most electronic devices, working with the wrong voltage could result in your device not turning on or risk frying its electrical components, sometimes beyond repair.
Depending on the device's consumption of energy and the battery's load, a single battery charge could last you anywhere from a few hours to multiple days.
